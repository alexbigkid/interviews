## 📈 ROI Calculation

### Automation Costs vs Annual Savings

| Complexity | Setup Cost | Good For | Break-even Point |
|------------|------------|----------|------------------|
| **Simple Script** | $500-2K | <30min tasks | $2K+ annual loss |
| **Basic Tool** | $1K-5K | 30-60min tasks | $5K+ annual loss |
| **Integration** | $5K-15K | 60-120min tasks | $15K+ annual loss |
| **Custom Solution** | $15K+ | 120min+ tasks | $30K+ annual loss |

### Quick ROI Formula
```
Annual Loss = (Duration in hours) × (Frequency per year) × $75
ROI = (Annual Loss - Automation Cost) / Automation Cost × 100%
```

## 🚀 Real Examples with Numbers

### High Priority (AUTOMATE NOW)
```
📦 Daily App Deployment
- Duration: 90 minutes
- Frequency: 365 times/year
- Annual Loss: 90 × 365 × $1.25 = $41,040
- Automation Cost: $3,000
- ROI: 1,268% ✅

🔄 Daily Database Backup
- Duration: 60 minutes
- Frequency: 365 times/year
- Annual Loss: 60 × 365 × $1.25 = $27,360
- Automation Cost: $2,000
- ROI: 1,268% ✅
```


**Simple Rule**: If you're losing more than $5K per year doing it manually, automate it.
